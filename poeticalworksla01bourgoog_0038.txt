When in the slipp’ry patha of youth
With heedless steps 1 ran,
Thine arm unseen convey'd me safo,
And led me up to man.

Through hidden dangem, toils, and deutha
It gently cleared my way,
And through the pleasing suares of vioe,
More to be fear¹d then they.

With health renew'd my sace;
And when in sins and sorrows sunk,

Reviv'd my soul with grace.

And aster death, in distant worlds,
The glorious theme renew.
