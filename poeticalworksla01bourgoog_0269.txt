SPARROWS SELF-DOMESTICATED

Nona ever shared the eocial feast,
Or as an inmate or a guest,

Beneath the celebrated dome,

Where once Sir Isaac had his home,
Who saw not (and with some delight
Perhaps he view’d the novel sight)
How numerous¹ at the tables ahere,
The aparrows heg their daily fare.
For there, in every nook and cell,
Where auch a family may dwess,
Sure as the vernal season comes
Their nesta they weave in hope os crumbs,
Which kindly given, may serve with food
convenient their unfeather’d brood;
And oft as with ita summons clear
The warning bell salutes their ear,
Sagacious listeners to the sound,
They floch from all the fields around,
Το reach the hospitahle hall,

None more attentive to the eall.
Arriani, the pensionary band,
Hopping and ehirping‚ close at hand,
