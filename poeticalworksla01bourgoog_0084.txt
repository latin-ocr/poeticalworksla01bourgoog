My small stook ol wit may Ι not misopply,
To fletter ill men, be they never so high;
Nor miepend tho few momente lstool from the grave,
ln lewning end oringing like ο dog or a slave.

May none whom Ilove, to so great richesb rise,
As to slight their acquaintance, and their old friends
despite ς
So loyv or so high moy none of them be,
As to move either pity or envy in me.
May Ι govern, &o

A friendship Ι wish ior, but alos! 'tis in vein,
J ove's stote-house is empty, and cen’t it supply,

So firm, thot no change ol times, envy, or goin,
0r flatt’ry, or woman, should hate power to untie.
Moy Ι govern, &e

But if friends prove unsoithlul, ond fortunea whore,=

Still may l be virtuous, though lem poor;

My lite then as useleSS, may lfreely resign,

When no longer l relish true wit and good wine.

t The Spanish proverb says,
Let not God make out· friends so rich, oo to forget us.

⁶ Fortuna, saevo laeta negotio, ot
Ludum insolentem ludere pertinax,
Transmutat incertos honores,
’ Nunc mihi, nunc elii, benigno.
