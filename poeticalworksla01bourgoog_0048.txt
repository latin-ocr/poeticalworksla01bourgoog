AN ODE.

11.
Soon as the evening shades prevaiL

The moon takes up the wond'rous tole,
And nightly‚ to the listening earth,
Repeots the story of her birth:

Whilst all the staro that round her burn,
And all the planeto in their turn,
Confirm the tidings, os they roll,

And spread the truth from pole to pole.

111.
What though, in solemn silence, all
Move round this dark terrestrial boll?
what though nor real voice nor sound
Amidst their radiant orbs be found?
ln reason's ear they all tejoice‚

And utter forth aglorious voice,
For ever singing as they shine,
‘¹ The hand that made us is divine.''
