THE SONG ΟΡ THE THHE cmunnuu. 15

Ye Jewish youths, his wond’rous praises teil,

Whose presence could the raging flames repel,

And turn to heaven the punishment oi heil;
Who on submissive fire triumphant rode,
The mun assuming, to deelnre the God.

All glory, praise, dominion, mejesty,
Now and ior everhsting ages, be
To the esseutinl One, end co-eteruel Three!
