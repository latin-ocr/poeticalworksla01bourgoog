DENNER'S OLD WOMAN.

TRANSLATED BT wihmunt 00WPBR, ΕΕΘ.

ln this mimic form of a metron in years.

How plainly the pencil oi Deuner appenni

The metron herself, in whose old nge we see

Not a truce ol decline-what u wonder is she Ι

No dimness of eye, und no cheek henging low,

Nor wrinkle, or deep-furrow'd irown on the browl

Her ioreheod indeed is her circled eround'

With looks like the ribbon with which they ere bound

While glossy and smooth. ond ss soh as the sliu

Oi s delicate pesch, is the down ol her chine

But nothing unplessunt, or sed, or severe,

Or thet indicates lile iu its winter-is here;

Yet ull is express’d with tidelity due,

Nor epimple or freokle concesl’d from the view.
Many lond ol new sights‚ or who cherish e teste

For lshours ol art, to the spectacle haste.

The youths all agree, that, would old nge inspiro

The passion ollone, hers would kindle the hre;

And the metrone with plensure confess thet they see χ

Ridiculous nothing or hideous in thee.

The nymphe sor themselves scarcely hope e decline,

0 wonderful woman! as placid es thine.
