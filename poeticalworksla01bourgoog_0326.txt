Here lies
Jonu Arcera, Esq; doctor of physic,
One of his Majesty’s Justices oi the Pence
For the County oi Westmorelund; who
Departed this life the eth os December, unccxxxv.
He was a worthy man, a skilsul physicinn,
An impartial magistrate, and an amiable friend:
His mind was generous‚ his temper sweet,
His understanding extensive;
In nature he was compassionete,
in virtue severe.
He adorned the reasonable being
With the dignity os morality ;
The true christian,
With the sanctity of religion.
He was a delight to his acquaintance,
An honour to his profession,
And an happiness to his country.
Dear and desirable is the memory of Dr. Archer,

Cruel end lamentable is the loss oi him:

Every eye overflows with tears,
Every breast is filled with sorrow,
And every house is become
The house of mourning.
