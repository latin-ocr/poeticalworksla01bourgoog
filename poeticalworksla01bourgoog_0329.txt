A LETTER

FROM

THE AUTHOR ΤΟ Α YOUNG LADY.

1 nu just come from indulging a very pleasiug

melancholy in a country churchyard‚ and paying a
respectful visit to the dead, of which Iam one day to
increase the number. As the solemnity and awt'ul-
ness oi the place does instantly effect the beholder,
the solitude and silence of it does equally dispose him
to attention and meditation: so that we nowhere
find amore uselul and improviug retirement. Every
monument has its instruction, and every hilloch has
its lessorr of mortality.

Ι have, by this means, in a short space oi time read
the history of the whole village3 and could tell the
names oi its principal families for the last thirty or
forty years: 1 might perhaps go a little higher; but
here, by the injury of time and weather‚ the register
begins to be interrupted, und the letters ore generally
so delaced, that ir an inscription can be made out, it

is not without much difficulty and conjecture.
