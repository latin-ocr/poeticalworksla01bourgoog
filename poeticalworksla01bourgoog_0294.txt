BPILOGUE To THE ADELPHI,

mnu n emam,

mmm.

Ροοι nurse is sent to bid you ull good b’ye,
Δ plain, but nent and tight old woman 1,
(Except what should exeepted he, you know,)
Δ very meet old ποί from top to toe.
But home, deur Faustus, try enchantments here,
And make e’en me a blooming maid appetu
To look with beauty‚ and to move with ease,
And nicely taught a thousand ways to please.
[ste waves a wand.
Speah, do long lappets wauton wave in air,
Does the ntrait ooewl prees down my auhurn hair?
Are patches rang’d of large and smaller aize?
Bure to my snowy chest, say, does my bosom riae?
My spreading hoop mise stiff its ampler sphera,
A sevenfold arch, an amphitheatre?
Aht conjuret Faustus, vain thy wand and still,
Nor are old women witches when they wilt
ἵ [Shebreaksthe wand.
Old as 1 was. I aun whate’er they say,
Grey were my lochs before, and still are grey.
No ntrutting hoop my dnngling clothes bears out,
Red tm, and red tamaius, my petticoat.
