MELISSA.

rhemmon ΒΥ HR· ri. 'washun

Ir, friend, a wife you meanto wed
Worthy oi your hoard and hed,
Thar she be vinnons, be your care,
Not too rich, ond not too fair:
One who nor hbours to display
Now complexione every day,
Nor, studying artificio} grece,
Out oi hoxes culis a sace.
Nor lirelong hours for dressiog speres,
Ploeing‚ to disploee hor hairs,
And straight replaco; an idle pin
*Ten times shisting out and in.
Nor doily varios, rainly nice,
Thrice her silhs, eod colours thrice:
Fond o'er and o'er her suits to range,
Chonging still, ond still to change.
Nor gods to pay, with busy air,
Trifling visits here and them
hong rapping at each door aloud,
Nuisance to a neighbourhood.
Ii e'er a play she deign to see,
(Very rarely shall it be‚)
