1010000. 319

010010 01 this world, as having nothing in them solid,
sincere, or lasting, 1 could readily forego: but the
looking-for 01 11101 unknown state, into which I am to
enter when 1 put off this body of fra'dty and corrup·
tion, is confounding and terrible. The prospect into
futurity is all darkness and uncertainty; nor can the
nearest relation or friend, who is gone before me,
re·pass the gulf that is fixed between 00, 10 give me
the least notice 01 10110101100 01 11. ’Τ10 11110 thought
that forbids me, polluted aa 1 now am, though everso
much wearied with life, to wish 101 my dissolution;
this reminds me, that, though the body be sleeping
and mouldering in the grave, the soul dieth not,
nor yet slumbereth: the place and condition 01 un-
bodied spirits, who 01 011 mankind knowetbl What
thought can conceive that which the eye never saw,
nor tbe 001 heard of? Who shall inform me 01 that
01010, 11010 whence there is no return?

Surely there is 0 reward 101 1110 righteous; the
souis 01 the faithful, after they are delivered from
the burthen of the flesb, 010 undoubtedly in joy and
felicity; but then where shall the ungodly and the
sinner appear? where shall 1, who have spent many
years in idleness and vanity‚ and have 00 merit of my
own to plead for mel where shall 1, who bave not
treasured up one good work to bespeak the favour of
the Almigbty; and have only the sufferings 01 Jesus
Christ-and those very sufferings often slighted,

trampled on, and rejected by 100-10 offer 10 my
