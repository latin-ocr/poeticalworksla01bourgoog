THE GLow-WORM.

A worm is known to stray5 ,
‘rhet shows by night a lucid beatu,
Which disappears by day.

Disputes have been, and still premii, ,
From whence his rays proceed5

And others to his head.

That kindles up the ekies,
Gives him a modicum of light
Propertion’d to his aize.

By such e lamp bestow’d,

To bid the truella, es he went,
Be ceresul where he trod ε
