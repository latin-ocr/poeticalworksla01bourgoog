Then to ber new love let her go,
And deck hetin golden amp
Be finest at ev'ry fine show.
And stolich it all the long day:
While (lofin, forgotten and gone,
No more shall be talk’d os, or seen,
Unloes when benaeth the pale moon
His ghost shall glide over the green.

WILLIAM AND MARGARET,

ΒΥ mvn) mm.

Wmm all was wrapt in dark midnight,
And all were fast asleep,

ln glided Margaret's grimly ghost,
And stood at William’s feet.

Her face was like the April morn,
elad in a wintry cloud;

And clay-cold was her lily-hand,
Thac held the sable shroud.

So shall the fairest sace appear,
When youth and years are flown ς
Such iube robe that kings must wear,
When death has rest their crown.
