AN ENIGMA.

'frenatam ΒΥ W. oowrttrt, EBG.

A narnia small, as small ean be,

In bullr and use, surpasses me,
Nor is my purchase dean η

For little and almost lor nought,

As many oi my kind are bought
As (lays are in the year.

Yet though but little use we boast,

And are procured at little eost,
The labour is not light;

Nor few artifloers it ealrs.

All skiliui in their several toalrs,
To fashion us aright.

One sures metal o'er the flre,
A second draws it into wire,
The rheate another plies3
Who olipa in lengthr the brazen thread
For him, who. ohafing every rhred‚
Givea all an equal size.
