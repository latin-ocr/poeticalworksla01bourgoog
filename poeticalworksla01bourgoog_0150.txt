Homei native home! 0 might he but repairi
He must-hewill, though death ettends him there.
He guen-end doom'd to perish on the sends
05 the full theetre, unpitied stands:
When io 1 the selisnme lion from his enge
Flies to devour him, famish'd into rege.
He flies z-hut viewing in his purposed prey
Theman, his hemer-pauses on bis wey,
And, sohen'd by remembrence into sweet
And kind composure, crouches at his feet.

But why, ye Romans? Whence your mute emme?
All this is natumiz Nature bede him rend

' An enemy ;-she bids him spere n friend.
