Lot faithful Abrsm's rsoe their off'rings bring,

By tuneful David taught his prsise to sing,

Their guide, their legislator, sud their kingr
Who spread o'er Egypt's lund substantiul night,
Who with s longer suu did Joshus's seith requite.

Ye priests oi (iod, let proise like incense riso,
Tho' Coruh's sons your order may despise,
And wish the priest himseiia sacrifice.
Praise him ior others too, and thus commend
Your greatest en’mies to your only friend.

Praise him, his servants who hove lssrnt to see,
There's uought so sweet ss this captivity,
From whence 'tis greatest bouduge to be free.

¹ Praise him, whose power osu grant whate’re you move, y
Whose ears willhesr your prayers, ior he is love.

Ye righteous souls, untointed with your oisy,

Spring thro' the vast expsnse and wiug your way,

To resch the confines oi eternsl dsy. r
Celestiol anthems sing with seraphs join’d,
And souis uubodied hless the slmighty mind.

Ye humble men, whom seli-admiring pride,

With ull its bsits could never drow asido,

Praise him, whose love does o'er the meek preside ς j
Who throws the purple tyrauts from their sest,
And makes the poor oi spirit rich snd great.
