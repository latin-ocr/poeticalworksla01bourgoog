ΟΝ THE ASGENSION.

ΥΕ numerous hosts of ongels bright,
Your winged multitudes prepare,
In all your grandeur to attend
The king os glory thro’ the air.

0 make your sweetest harmony‚

As he triumphant takes his flighr;
Towering on high above the sun,

Thro' realms immense of spacious light.

Ι In choicest hymno, melodious throng,
Salute the conqueror, your king;

ln joysul loys aud loudert simius, γ
Ye blest, your God returuing sing. - ’

Andron, in majesty divine,

He sits eurob'd by ’s Pother's side;
But still rouchsafes to intercede

For sinsul man, sor whom he died.

Thon, man, thy dear Redeemer biesS,
With thankful heato as they above;
with them begin a song of praise,
A song os endless us his love.
