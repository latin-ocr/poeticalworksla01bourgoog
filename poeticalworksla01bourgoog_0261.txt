THE SNAIL.

To grass, or leaf, or huit, or wall,
The Snail etichs close, nor fears to fall,
As if he grew there, house and all

' Together.

within that house secure he hides,
When danger imminent hetidee
Of etorm, or other herm besides

of weather.

Give but hie horns the slightest touch,
His sels-collecting power is such,
He shrinhs into his house with much

Displeesure.

Where'er he dwells, he dwells alone,
Except himself has chattels none,
Well eatisfled to be his own

whole treasure.
