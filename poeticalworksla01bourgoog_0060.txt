COLIN'S couPLffiT.

Ιῐ ncnous 1οη.

Durum buide ι dent num,
Δ shepherd comken m him

And while ι fiko nymph ns his theme-
A wsslow supponet! ἰὼ Μ.

The winde. that blev over the phin.
Tohhsighswithnsighdidrepln

And the brook, in return to his puin,-
Ran mournfully murmuring by.

Alae! silly swain that ῐ was!

Thus sedly compleining, he cried3
When first 1 beheld thet fair fece,
'Twere better bysar I hed died z
She talk'd, and 1 blest the dear tongue3
When she smil’d, ’twas a pleesure too great:
Ilisten’d·‚ end cty’d, when she sung,
Was nightingale ever eo sweet!

How foolish was Ito believe,

She could doat on so lowly a elown!
Or, that her fond heert would not grieve, η

Το forsake the fine solk os the town ! .
To think thet a beeuty so gay.

So kind and so constant would prove;
Or go eled like our maidens in grey‚

Or llve {n e cottage on love !
