’1Ἢὲ now-nno?

And shouldst thou, compell'd by a frost,
Come again to my window or door,

Doubt not an affectionate host,
Only payns thou puidst me before.

This music must needs be confess'd
To flow from a fountain above ;

Else how should it work in the meast
Unchangeable friendship and love?

And who on the globe can be found,

Save your generation and oure,
That can be delighted by sound,
Or boasts any musical pow’rs?

THE SNOWDROP.

Wun head reclin’d‚ the snowdrop see!
The first of Flora's progeny,

ln virgin modesty appear,

To hail and weleome in the year l

Fearless of winter, it defles

The rigour of inclement skieS,
And early hastens forth to nring
The tidings of approaching spring.
