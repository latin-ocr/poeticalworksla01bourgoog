THE ΙΝΝΟΟΕΝΤ THIEF.

rnhusnh'rzu ΒΥ Wthth GOWPEB„ ESQ.

Noe a flower ean be found in the fields‚

Or the spot that we till for our measure, .
From the largest to least, but it yields

The hee, never-wearied, a treasure.

Scaree any she quite unexplored‚
with a diligence truly exact ς

Yet, steal what she may sor her heard,
Leaves evidence none of the fact.

Her lucrative task she pursues‚
And pilfers with so much address,
Thac none of their odour they lose,
Nor charm by their beauty the less.

Not thus inoffensively preys
The eanher-worm, indwelling foe!
His voracity not thus allays

The sparmW, the finch, or the crow.
