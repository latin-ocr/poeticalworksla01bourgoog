Then see the sorrows os my hem,
Ere yet it be too late,
And hear my Saviour’s dying gronna,
To give those sorrows weight.

Her pardon to procure,
Who known thy only Son has died,

To make that pardqn sure.

Χ , “’ Tun spacious firmament on high,
With all the blue ethered sky,
The spangled heav'ns, ashining fram,
Their great original proclaim.
The unwearied sun, from day to day.
Does his Creator’s pow'r display;
And publishes to ev'ry land
The work os an almighty hand.
