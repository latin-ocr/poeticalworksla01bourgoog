Ye clouds with sulphur cherg'd‚ his preise resound,

Louder then thunder in your ceverns bound;

Lightnings, thet quichly die, ond dying wound,
Ere yet your momentury flesh is done,
Praise him, whose iustre can be never gone.

Praise him, Ο earth, whilst thou thyseli shait last ς

Thy solid orb in liquid ether placed,

Tho' hung on nothing, is ior ever fust:

’ Praise hieu whose being is sustain'd by norrea
Himeelfis contre os himself aione.

Ye mounts end hilis, crowu'd with a pompous loed
of grows, where idols placed their old abode,

Resound the preises oi a real God‚
Whoshow'd his goodness, who proclaim’d his will,
On Horeb’s mountain, and on Sine's hill.

Praise him, ye grecus, by fruitiul nature horn,

And rising crops that pienteous wales adorn

Where zephyrs rustle thro’ the wevy corn t
Who clothes in greater stete each springing green
Thon thet which drew irorn sar the southern queen.

Ye wells end streame, your source oi moisture know,
Who mede, when urged of old his pow’r to show,
Forth from th’ obedient roch the weters flow.

Nor is the iountain of his praises dry,

But unexhousted stores sor ever will supply.
