Praise him, ye eold, thet humen soree restrains,
Dead'ning the sense, end thrilling in the veins.

His preire for ever be by you extoll'd,

Inflamed with erdours by th’ extreme of eold.

Praise him, you frost, long es the srozen see

ln midst os storms enjoys e calm by them

And spotlese enow, the type of purit55

Be this your business, ye leborioue days,

And silent nights silver'd with glimmering reys;

Exempt from every work, but that of preise.
Whose piercing eye does equal power display
In derkest midnight, and in brightest day.

Praise him, Ο light, in heavenly beems array’d;
Parentes day, end first os beinge, shade;
Praise him, who reign'd before the world was mede;

Who dwells in brightness, and who rides in night.
Mejestie darkness, end elluring light.
