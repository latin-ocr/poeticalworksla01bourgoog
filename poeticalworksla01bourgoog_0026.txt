Praise him, 0 moon, in borrow'd lustre might, ἵ

In this be fixed, thou ohenging queen oi night. Ῐ

Ye iwinkling storo oi light, your proioes show,
'Tio he that does your nomes ond numbers know, i

Eeoh sior thoi does to man its beams dispense-r

Praise him, as ii inspired by some intelligence.

Praise him, ye gentle ond reiteshing showers,
Pmise him, ye dews3 whose pearly moisture poure
Odours and beouiies on the vemal fiowers.
Who more· should choose t'exait his name then you?
He father io oi rain, begetter oi the dew.

Ye windo, thot, where you plenae, your oound moy send,
ln hymno osJoy your pious breathings spend
Ohi proioe him without bound, and without end,
