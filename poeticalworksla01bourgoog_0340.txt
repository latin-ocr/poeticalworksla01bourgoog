But oh 1 moy the goodness ot God, isthere be still
meroy lest sor me, while it is yet called to-day, before
the night oometh on, so assist me with his grece in
working out my salvation, that neither the desire
of life, nor the dread of death, moy withdraw my Ἴ
thoughts from him 1 but that, in this=my day, 1 moy
consider the things which make for my peace: before
they ore hid from my eyes. Irr humble confidenoe
thereos, andin full assuronoe ot' his most grocioos
rneroy to all returning sinners, 1 will endeavour to

fortify and prepare myself against the terrors ot
death.

THE END.
