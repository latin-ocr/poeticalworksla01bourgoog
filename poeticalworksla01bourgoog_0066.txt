Wlfflnll Ano ΜΛΙΟΑΙΙΕΤ.

Her bloorn vves like the springing flower,
Thot sips the silver devm

The rose vves budded in her oheelr‚
And opening to the view.

But love hod, like the eanher-vvorm,
Consum’d her eorly prime ι

The rose grew pole, and lest her oheelr;
She died before her time.

Anake, she oded, thy true love calls,
Come from her midnight grave;
Now let thy pity hear the maid,
Thy love resus'd to seve.

' This is the derh end seersul hour.

When injur'd ghosis eompleim
Now dreary graves give up their deod,
To haunt the seithless swein.

Bethinlr thee, William, of thy fault,
Thy pledge, end broken oelh;
And give me book my melden vow,

And give me back my iroth.

How could' you say my fece was sair,
And yet that sace lorsalre?

How could you vin my virgin heart,
Yet leave that heert to break?
