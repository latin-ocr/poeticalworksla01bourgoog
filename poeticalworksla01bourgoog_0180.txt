Thmcmh parents, athis birth,
Moum their babe with many a tear,
But, with undissembled mirth,
Place him breathless on his bier.

Greece and Rome, with seem,
“ 0 the savages 1³⁸ exclaim

¹⁶ Whether they rejoice or mourn‚
‘⁴ well entitled to the name 1¹⁹

But the cause of this concern.
hnd this measure, would they hace,
Even they might somewhat leam
From the savages of Thrace.
