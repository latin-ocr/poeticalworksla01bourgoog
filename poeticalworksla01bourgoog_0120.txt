10⁰ m naaman.

The θοντο ahe wore along the day ς
And ev'ry nymph and shepherd said,

That in her hair they look'd more gay
Than glowing in their native bed.

Undrest at evening, when she found
Their colours lost, their odonre past,
She chang'd her look, and on the ground

Her garland and her eye she cast.

That eye dropt sense distinet and clear,
As any mnse’s tangue could speak;
When from its lid apearly tear
Ran trickling down her beauteous eheek.

Dissembling what 1 knew too well,
⁸⁴ My love, my life‚'' said 1, “explain
Thia change os humour3 pr'ythee tell,
That falling tear, what does it mean?

She sigh'd; she smiled; and to the flowere
Pointing, the lovely moralist said,
See, friend, in some few fleeting honre,
’ See yonder‚ what a change is madel

Ah mei the'hlooming pride oi May
And thet os beenty are but one:

Aa noon both flonrish bright and gay;
Both inde at evening‚ pale and gone.
