The love, that from besuty is drawn,
By kindness you ought to improves

Soft looks and gay smiles ure the down,
Fruition's the sunshine of love:

And though the bright beums of your eyes
Should be olouded‚ that now ure so gay,

And darkness possess all the skies, Ι
We ne'er oon surget it was day.

Old Durby, with J oon by his side,
You've osten regarded with wonder ;
He’s dropsicah she is sore-eyed‚
Yet they’re ever unessy asunder.
Together they totter about,
Or sit in the sun at the door;
And st night, when old Darby's pot's out,
His Joan will :nos shoke o whiff more.

No beuuty nor wit they possess,
Their several suilings to smother;
Then what arethe chorms, can you guess.
That make them so fond of each other?
’Tis the pleasing remembtunoe of youth,
The eudearments which youth did hestowt
The thoughts of post plessure and truth.
The hest os our blessings below.
