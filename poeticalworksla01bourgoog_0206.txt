186 Α nonunt.

The whiteet hendo thet secret honrd
0st visit: and the sair

Pteserve it in their bosom slored,
As with nmiser'e cere.

Thence implemento ol every size.
And sorm’d sor various use,

(They need bnt lo consult their eyes‚)
They rendily produce.

The largest and the longest kind
Possess the loremost page,

Α sort most needed hy the blind,
Or nearly such from ege.

The full cherged leaf, which next ensues‚

Presents in hright arrny
. The smeller sort, which matrone use.

Not quite so blind ns they.

The third, the forth, the fifth supply
what their occasions ask,

Who with n more discerning eye
Perlorm e nicer tnsk.

But still with regular decrense
From size to size they fall,

ln every leal grow less end less ;
The last nre least of all.
