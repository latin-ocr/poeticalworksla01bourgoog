THE SONG OF THE THRRE cartonen. ¹3

Ye rivers, bear his praise ιο every lond,
Praise him, ye sees, by whose supreme command
Your greatest rugeio bounded by the send.
No hounds or limits ere assigned you here,
Nor oen your utmost forces go too fer.

Praise him, ye wholes, ond all the silver trein,
Ther, on the fifth day made, the watery mein
Within its specious bosom does contain:
His praise, ye iish, by you be always sung,
Tho* mute, ιο bless your Mulier, find e tongue.

Praise him, ye fowls, exelt his name, whute’er
Or skims the water, or divides the air,
Who clothes and ieeds you with paternel cere.
Repeet his preise ιο every echoing daie.
Ye morning lark, and evening nightingale.

Praise him, ye beorn, thot shedy iorests sway,
Who seeds she lions mering for their prey‚
Ye temer kinds, siret human soree obey,
Present your proise, more grateful ιο the skies
Thon thousands of you slain in sacrifice.

Adore, ye sons of men, his ansul name,
Tho' form’d oi eerth iill’d with etherial fleme,
(ἔσει iu the noblest, end the finest frome.

het lordly men his sovereign's praise declaro,

And heeuteous women bless the truly sair.
