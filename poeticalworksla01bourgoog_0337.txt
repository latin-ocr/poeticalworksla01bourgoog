time and opportunity to looir back into my past lite,

and with seriousness and attention to consider my
latter end.

Upon recollection, 1 find the offences os my youth
and the transgressions oi my riper years are so
many, that, were not the mercy of God as infinite as
his justice, 1 might despair of pardon. But, through
the merits and intercession oia crucified Savium,
I humbly hope forgiveness. As the Almighty has
himself deciared that he deiighted not in the death
of a sinner; 1 beseeoh him that his extensive com-
passion may reaoh even unto me; and in dutit'ul
confidence thereos, 1 submit myseli to his holy will,
with resignation, constancy‚ and oheerfulness.

For that part of my hehaviour that relates to my
sallon-creature man, if that should hoppen to he less
exceptionable, it 1 have not willingly and delibera-
taly injured my neighbour‚ by caiumny, oppression,
or extortion, not unto me, but unto God be the
praise. 1 hope it may in some measure compensate
sor my many other misdeads, and so iar procura the
favour and candour oi all those who are so sensible
of their own failings as to overlook and iorget mine.

There is one thing which Ihave osten heard myseli
charged with; and that is my neglect oi entering
into hoiyorders, and adue preparation ior that sacred
office. Though 1 think myseii in strictness answer-
able to none but God and my own conscience3 yet,
t'or the satisfactiones the person that isdearest to me,
