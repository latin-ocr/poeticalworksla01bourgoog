LUCY ΑΜ) cour.

‘⁴ Ah, Colini give not her thy tows.
Vowe due to me alone3

Nor thou, fond maid, receive his hiso,
Nor think him all thy own.

To-morrow in the ohurch to wed,
Impatient, both prepare ;

But know, fond meid3 arrd know, false marr, ἵ

That Luoy will be there.

‘¹ There bear my oorse, ye comedes, bear,
The bridegroom blithe to meet; ’

He in his wedding trim so gay,
1 in my winding-sheet.”

She epoho, she died ;-her corse was borne,
The bridegroom blithe to meet;

He in his wedding trim so goy,
She in her winding-sheet.

Then what were perjur'd Colin'e thoughts?
How were those nuptiale kept?

The hridemen flock'd round Luey dead,
And ai] the village wept.

Compassion, shame, remorse, despair,
At once his bosom swell;

The damps of death bodew'd his brows,
He shook, he groan'd he fell.
