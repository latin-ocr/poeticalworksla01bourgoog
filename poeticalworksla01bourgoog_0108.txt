THE INVITATION TO THE RED-BREAST.

Swrrrr bird, whom the winter constrains- l
And seldom another it ean-
To seelr a retreat while he relgns

ln the well-shelter'd dwelling os man,
Who never een seem to intrude,

Though in all places equally free,
Come, ost es the seeson is rude,

Thou ert sure to be welcome to me.

At sight of the first seeble rey
That pierces the clouds of the east,
To inveigle thee every day,
My windows shall show thee a least.
For, taught by experience, lknom
Thee mindful os beneht longÍ¾
And thet, thankful for all 1 bestow,
Thou wilt pay me with many e song.

Then, soon es the swell of the buds
Bespeaks the renewal ol spring,

Fly hence, isthou wilt, to the woods,
Go where it shall plesse thee to sing:
