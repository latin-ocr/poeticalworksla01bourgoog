How does my love pass the long day?
Does Mary noi tend a sew sheep?
Do they never eareiessiy stray‚

While happily' she lies asleep?

Tweed’s murmurs should luil her to rests
Kind nature induiging my bliss;

To relieve the soit paine of my bremt,
l’d steri an ambrosial kiss.

'Tis she does the virgins excel,
No beauty with her ean compare;
Love's greces allround her do dwell;
She’s fairest. where thousands rere fair.
Say, charmer, where do thy floeks strayi
Oh 1 tell me, at noon where they seed 1
Shall 1 seek them on sweet-winding Tay,
Or the pleasanter banks of the Tweed?

LUOY AND COLIN. ·

Or Leinster, iamed sor maidens seir,
Bright Luey was the grsee;

Nor e’er did Lih'y's iimpid stream
Refieet so fair a face,

Till luckless love, and pining esre,
Impair’d her rosy hue,

Her corel lips, and damask cheelrs,
And eyes oi glossy hlue,
