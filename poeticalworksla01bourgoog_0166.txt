At first he aims at what he beuter

And, list'ning close with both his ears,
Just cctches ct the sound;

But soon articulates cloud,

Much ιο th’ amusement of the crowd,
And stuns the neighbours round.

A querulous old woman’s voice

His humorous talent next employs;
He scolds, and gives the lie.

And now he sings‚ and now is sick,

Here, Sally, ‘Susam come, come quicl,
Poor Poll is like ιο die l

Belinda and hcr'bird l 'tls rare

To meet with such a well-match’d pair}
The lenguage and the tone,

Each character in every part

Sustain’d with so much grece end art,
And both in unison.

When children first begin to spell,
And stammer out a syllable,
We think them tedicus creatures r
But difficulties soon abate,
When birds are ιο be taught ιο prate,
And women are the teachers.
