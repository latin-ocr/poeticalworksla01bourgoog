And you. my companions οο deur,
Who sorrow to see me betraytL

whatever 1 suffer, sorbeat,
Forbenr to accuse the false maid.

, Tho' through the wide world 1 should range,

’Τίο in vain from my fortune to flyz

‘Twas her's to be false and to ehmge;
'Tis mine to be constant and dies

Is, while my hard sate 1 sustam,
In her bremt any pity is found,

Lot her come with the nymphe of the plaim
And see me laid low in the ground.

The laet humble boon that Iereve,

le to made me with cypress and yew;
And when she looks down in my grave,

bot hm· own that her shepherd was true
