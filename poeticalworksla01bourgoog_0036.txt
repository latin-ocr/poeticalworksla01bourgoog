HYMN THE FlRST.

1.
Wnnh all thy mercios, Ο my God.

My rising soul surveys‚
Transporled with the view l’m lost
ln wonder, love, and praise.
ιι.
0 how shall words with equal warmth
The gratitude declare,
That glows within my ravish'd breastl
But thou canst read it there.
111.
'l'hy providenee my life sustam’d,
And all my wants rehem,
When in the silent womb llay.
And hung upon the hreast.
1v.
To all my weak complaints and eries
Thy mercy lent an ear,
Ere yet my feehle thoughts had learnt
To form themselves in pray’r.
V.
Unnumber'd comforts lo my soul
Thy tendet care bestow'd‚
Before my infant heart conceiv'd
From whom those comforls flow'd.
