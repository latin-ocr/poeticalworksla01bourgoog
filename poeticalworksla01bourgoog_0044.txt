HYMN m 'mum

My lise, if thou preserv'st my lise,
Thy sacrifice shall be;

And death, is death must be my doom.
shall join my soul to thee.

HYMN THE THIRD.

1.
Wmm rising from the bed of death,
O’erwhelm'd with guilt and sear,

1 see my Maker sace to sace,
011 1 how shall 1 appear!

11.

ls yet, while pardon may be found,
And mercy may be soygffi,

My beart with inward horror shrinkm
And trembles at the thought.

111.
When thou, O Lord, shalt stand disclos'd
In majesty severe,
And sit in judgment on my soul,
0111 how shall luppear!
m.
But thou hast told the troubled som,
Who does her sins lament,

The timely tribute of her tears
Shall endless woe prevent.
