THE CAUSE WON.

venustum> Ιῖ W. ΟΟΠΡΕΒ, 380.

Two neighbours furiously dispute‚

A field the subject oi the suit:

Trivinl the spot, yet such the rege

With which the comhutents engage,

’Twere hnrd to tell who covets most

The price-at whutsoever eost.

The pleedings swell: words still suffice:

No single word but hes its price;

No term but yields some seir pretence

For novel end incrensed expense.
Defendant thus becomes s nome,

Which he thet bore it may disclairn,

Since both, in one description blended‚

Are pleintiffs-when the suit is ended.

PLUS scinu OPORTET, QUAM LOQUI. r

Qun gravitas oculisi et quae constantia fronti!
Sobrius ut toto pectore bubo sapit!

Ales Pythagora dignus, dignusque Minervei
Sermonis parcus, consiliique tenax!

Oh habitet tecum, bubo, et sit pectore in isto,
Quicquid hebes: quoties effluet, omen erit.
