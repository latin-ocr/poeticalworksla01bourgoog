Paix Thames shehunss. and every neigbb'ring grove
Staret! to ⁸0st mm, and gentle love.

Go, with thy Cynth'n, hurl the pointed spw

At the rough buu, or chace the flying dcet:

At human huns we fling, nor ever miss the game.

Τιιι pride of ev'ry grove 1 chose,

The violet meet, and lilyfair, ὖ
The dappled pink‚ and blushing rose,

To deck my,eharming Chloe’s hair.

At morn the nymph vouchsased to place
Upon her brow the various wreath;

The flow’rs less blooming than her face,
The scent less fragrant than her breath.
