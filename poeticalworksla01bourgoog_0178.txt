THE CANTAB.

rurusrrreo ur v. covrru, rso.

Wrrutvvo sputu or one-eud nogreet matter which-
Boots bought, or boots borrow'd, awhip or a switcb‚
Five sbillings, or less, sor the hire of his beast,

Paid part into hand r-you must walt sor the rest.

Thus equipt, Academicus climbs up his horse,

And out they both sully, lor better or worse;

Hie beart void of sear, eud as light as a leuther,

And in violent berteto go not knowing whither. κ

Through the fields and the towns (see l) he scam-
pers along,

And is loolr'd at end laugh'd by old and by young ς

Till at length overspent, and his sides smear'd vvitb
blood, ἵ

Dovvn tumbles his horse, man and all in the mud. l

ln avrggon, or ebaise, shall he fluish hio route? Ἴ

Ohl scandalous fatel he must do it on soot. l

Young gentlemen, hear l-I am older than you,

The advice that l give l heve proved to be true: y

Wherever your journey may be, never doubt it,

'l'he laeter you ride, you're the longer about it.
