There is a book, which wc may call
(lts excellence is such)

Alone a library, though small ;
The ludica thumh it much.

Words none, things numerous it contains:
And things with words compared,
Who needa be told, that has hia hrains,

Which merit most regards?

Osttimes its leaves of scarlet hue
A golden edging boast;

And open'd, it displays to view
Twelve peges at the most.

Nor name, nor title, stamp'd behind,
Adorne its outer part;

But all within 'tis richly lined,
Α magaaine of art.
