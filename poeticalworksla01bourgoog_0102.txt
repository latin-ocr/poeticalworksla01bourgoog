From the vain bride, (ahl bride no moret)
The varying crimson fled;

When, stretch'd before her rival's corso,
She saw het husband deod.

He to his Luoy¹s new-mode grave,
Convey’d by trembling swains,

One mould with her, beneoth one eod.
For ever now remeius.

on at this grove, the constant hind
And plighted maid ore seem

With garhnds gay, ond true-love hnots,
They deck the sacred green.

But, swain soresworn‚ whoe'er thou art,
This hallow'd spot sorbeam

Rememher Colin's dreadsul sete,
And sear to meet him there.

ADVICE TO CHLOE.

Dran Chloe, while thus beyond measure,
You treet rne with doubts and disdain‚

You roh all your youth of its pleneme,
And hoard upon old nge of pain.

Your maxim, that love is still founded
On oharms that will quiokly deooy,

You'll dud to he very ill grounded,
When onte you its dictatos ohey.
