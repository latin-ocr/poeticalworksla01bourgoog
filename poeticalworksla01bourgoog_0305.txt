0 uunrroues spectatoresque benigni,
0 ell ye hearers end ye stenders by;
Crede mihi dolet hoo munus mihi demandari t
The epilogue puts me in e great quandary:
effudique seles, mee lex consumitur et toute r
My vitis at en end, mylanis out.
Nescio quid dico, aut dico quod non ego nosco ;
1 know not what to say, or say not what Ι knovv.
Why truly-may it plesse you-I demum
Memoria sine brief is never sure.

We, cs we humbly do conceive, may move
These honouruble benches, as above,
That we may now be cliente unto you;
'Tis not ‘in forma pauperis’ we sue:
And as we in your judgment stand, thet vve
May likevvise in your honours' favour be.
This being granted, may be, gentlemen,
We'll humbly move this court to sit egein,
At'ter due notice hovv, end where, and when.
And so ye stsnd sdjourned.
