Ο ! what a fund os genius, pent
ln narrow space is here!

This volume's method and intent
How luminous and clear!

lt leaves no render at a loss
Or posed, whoever reads:

No commentator's tedious gloss,
Nor even index needs.

Search Bodley's many thousands 0'erl
No book is treasured there,

Nor yet in Granta’s numerous stote.
Thau may with his compare.

No I-rival none in either host
of this was ever seen,
Or, that contents could justly boast,
’ So brilliant and so keen.
