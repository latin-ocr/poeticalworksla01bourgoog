EPILOGUE TO HARRY THE FOURTH.

stom e! meme.

Tm pleguy Percy almost broke my beck ;
Ney end my wind too ;-b0y, e cup of sack.
There’s not e men ceres less then 1101110011,
But pleguy fighting puts one out of breeth:
Yet if bright honour cells me to e frey,

Ι shall be very bold-to-run away. Ι

welk when the king makes plump sir John e lord,
Then l’m resolv’d-never to keep my word.
First I'll begin with hostess Quiekly: much
She 'gine to talk 01 ladyship end coaeh;

A body cannot owe ’m e little money,

But streit the jedes must think of matrimony.
But yet a triek worth two os that I'll play her ;
Poor fool! nor love nor money will 1 pey her.
If in the streete civil dun should come;

Pray come to-morroW, and-l'll hesrom home.
If in the hell a number should appear,

My lord 's asleep sir, in his elbow cheir.

When tredeemen grew immtient for their due,

'Tie so long standing-never talk os 't-'pshewl
I’ve good preserment in my eye sor you.

For sempstress nou, How deth Mise Prue? poor soon
I'll pay for’t, send her to the dencing school.
