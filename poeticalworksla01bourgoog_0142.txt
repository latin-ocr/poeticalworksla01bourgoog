oua ΟΝ THE unam 01‘ Α [ΔΜ.

Death’s delicioue banquet-we
Perieh even from the womb,

Swisser than a shadow fiee,
Neurish’d but to seed the temb.

Seede of mereiless disease
burk in all that we enjoy;
Some that waste ue by degrees,
Some that suddenly destroy.

And is life o’erleap the bourn
Gommon to the sons of men,

What remaine, but thet we mourn, '
Dream, and dote, and drivel then.

Faetus moon ean wax and avane,
Sorrow comem and, while we grean,
Pant with anguish, and complain,
Half our years are fled and gone.

Is a few (to few ‘tis given),
Lingering on this earthly stage,¹

Oreep and halt with steps unaven
Το the period of an age,

Wherefore live they. but to see ι
cunning, arrogance, and soree,

Sights lamented much by thee,
Hofding their aecustom’d course?
