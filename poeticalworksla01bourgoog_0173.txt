THE FANATIC.

Wnen first to speak uprises Simon Pure,

Sileni he stands, with countenance demure;

he coughs‚ he spits¹ with many a hawk and hem,
To clear a way for words, and uitet them:

His gloves beside him on the pulpis lie.

His two broad hands to heav¹n are lined high ; Ι

With eyelids shut he groans, sot, closely pent,
The murm'ring spirit struggles ior a vent;
n length a voice breaks out beneath his hat,
Another, and another after that:
Bm sair and soit, with frequent pauses mixt,
And many a sigh, and many a groan beiwiffl
Till by degrees he sans, with zealot ire.
The dormant coals of Puritanio fite.
Anon, bestente, he bounds, on tiptoe stands, ⁸
Roars with his voice, and hammers with his hands ς
The strength of lnngs he tries, he panis, he blows‚
And down his cheeks the sweat profusely flows:
To ev'ry soul he threatens instant doum,
And a sanatio tempest shakes the room.

So rising Boreas first, with lenient breem,
Faus the light leaves and murmura thro' the tieem¹
His cheeks inflated soon a tempest bion.
Shake·their inii tops above, their trunks below:
