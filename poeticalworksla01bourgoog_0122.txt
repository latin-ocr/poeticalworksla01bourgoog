ht down poor Stella dano'd and sung,
Tho om'rous youth oround her bow’d;
At night her fatal knell was rung,
1 saw, and lriss’d her in her shroud.

Such as she is, who died to-day,
Such Ι, alasl may be to-morrow;

Go, Damon, bid thy muse display
The justice ol thy Chloe's sorrow.

THE WREATH.

Swrrr, lovely, choslo,
Ye lilies, haste,
That in the vollies breolhe=
To Phyllis hoste,
Sweet, lovon, choslo.
For Phyllis twine the wrorlh.

Yo rores, come,
With virgin bloom,

The pride ol gardens own'd;
That from your bed

Diffusive shed
Ambrosial odoursround.
