RECIPROCAL Kranness THE PRIMARY
an ΟΡ NATURE.

Taurumue ΙΥ W. coma, HG·

Amoenus, from hio injured iord, in dread
Os instant death, to Lybia’s desert fled;
Tired with his toilsome ssight, and paroh'd with heet,
He epied et length a eovern's oool retreat ς
But source hed given to rest his weery frume,
When, hugest of his kind, a lion omne:
“ He ronr'd approeehingz but the savnge din
To pleintive murmuro changed-arrived within,
And with expressive looks, his lifted pou
Presenting, eid implored from whom he saw·
The fugitive, through terreret e stand,
Dared not ewhile efford hie trembling hnnd;
But holder grown, et length inherent found
A pointed thorn, end drew it from the wound. κ
The oure was wrought ;-he wiped the sanione blood, ¹
And flrm end free from pain the lion stood.
Again he seeks the wilde, and day by day
Regeies his inmete with the parted prey.
N or he diedeins the dole, though unprepared,

Spreed on the ground, end with a iion shared.
But thus to live-still iost-eequester'd still.. ’
Sceroe seem'd his lord's revenge a heevier ill.
