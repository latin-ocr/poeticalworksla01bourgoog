'‘'l'o attempt lo praise these exquisitely simple, plous, and truly
Christian Dleeourses, aster they have enjoyed favour wilh the
Christian world sor so many years, and passed through so many
editione, would bea work of supererogat'on. We may, however, be
permitted to observe that they appear to have been in equal esteetn
with the learned and unleerned, though professedly addressed te
tha latter elasa. Bishop Tomline, to whom they are inscribed, and
inte whose hands they came anonymoualy, suppoeing they were the
predueeion or some pinus divine, and not ofMiss haedleh inreperted
ίο have said, that ι’] he knew the author, he would piee him a livium
aad he also recommended them to those whom he ordained. The
are, besides, especially calculated for the use ol familia!
