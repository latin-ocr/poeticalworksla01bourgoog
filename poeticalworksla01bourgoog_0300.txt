EPILOGUE TO ANDRIA,

Π mio.

Roora here-for 1 am corne ιο vent my joy;

Son Pamphilus has got a chopping boy.

Mueh preparation there has been, 1 aee.

Against this time, though all unknown ιο me.

Here stood a tankard worthy of its wine,

There did a cradle in rich damnsk shine,

caps, clouts, and swnddling clothes hung dangling οο ,

the line z ff

For sons get children οι their sathers’ eost, ι

All things are trim, but we must pay the roast. ι
Βοι yet here may remein a dismal scene,

All are perplext ’twixt joy and sear within:

Mysis, poor tim'rous aoull forgets to prattle;

Ansswhat's morestrange the toping nurseherbottle; ³

Crito, poor man! longe ιο be jogging home¹

But dares not stir before he knows his doom.

'l'o keep ua all in temper then, 1 pray‚ ¹

Smile on the entertainment of this playr ι

Dismiss us kindly ιο our sugar'd sack, ι

And make it not indeed a groening calae: ι

So shall we rrish each sex may ever find,

Their heerera candid, end specntors kind.
