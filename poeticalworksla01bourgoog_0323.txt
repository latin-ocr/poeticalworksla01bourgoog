Hrc infra jacet,
E silentio et tenebris
ln lucis et gloriae transferenda aeternitatem,
Egregii nominis mulier
Terris idcirco date et adempta,
Ut intelligerent homines
Quo virtus amore
Amplectenda sit incolumis,
’ Quainvidia
·¹ Quaerende sit sublata.

lN BARBADOS. ’

Sacred to the memory¹
of Anno, the beloved wife
of Mn. Dunnnr Woonnnrnen.

Ir the remembranee ol whete’er was deor
Deserves the pious tribute of a tear,

Bestow it on the dust that sleepeth near:
That procious dust, which living did comprise
The fair, the good, the graeeful, and the wise.
Bestow a teer; nor think thy sorrow lost,
Another, and another, should it costa

The real worth of virtue ne’er is known,

Till rovish'd hom before our eyes, and gone.

She died
October 5, nnccxxxrx.
Aged xxxvr.
