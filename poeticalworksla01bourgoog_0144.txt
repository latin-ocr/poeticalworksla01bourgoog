An that we with wonder viem

Emh produces nothing new.

Thee we gratulata, content,

Life for us as calmly spent,
'l'hough but half the length of thine.

laum inmte, full os mirth,
Chirping on my kitchen hearth,
Wheresoe'er be thine abedo,
Always harbinger os good,

Pay me sor thy warm retreat
With a song more sort and sweet;
In return thou shalt receive

Such a strain as Ι can give.
