“ ΤΟ THE KING.

Gonrn nnme*, which in our rolls recorded etnrrds,
Lends, honours, nnd protecte the learned bando,
Aooept this offering, to thy bounty due, ’

And Roman wealth in English sterling view.

Reed here, how Britain, once despised‚ ean raise
Ae ample sums, as Rome in Caesar'e days3

Pour forth ns numerous legions on the plain,

And with more dreodful novies owe the moin.

⁶ The King's name stands first in the buttery-book of
Christ-Clruroir College.
