Tum ise bird, who by his coet,
And by the hoarseness of his note,
Might be supposed a crowt .
A great frequenter of the church,
where bishop·like he finds a perch,
And dormitory too.

That turns end turns, to indicate
From what point blows the weather;

'Tis in the clouds-that pleeses him,

Thither he wings his airy ssight,
And thence securely sees
The bustle and the raree-show,
That occupy mankind belom
Secure end at his ease.
