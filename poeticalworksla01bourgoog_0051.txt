ΟΝ ALL SAlNTS' DAY.

Han ye, whose sacred multitudes
In numbers cannot be exprest;
Hail γε, that fill with winged crowds
The joyful regions os the blest;
To you our humhle verse we bring;

’Tis you instruct us how to sing.

Ye hlest attendants os your Lord‚
While he vouehsafd on earth to preach
By him as Messengers the word
Throughout the world sent forth to teach;
’Twas you the happy tidings brought,
Yourselves performing what you taught.

Ye propheto, who with ardent zeal
And knowledge heavenly possest,
To future ages did reveal
The secrets os Jehovah’s breast;
' 'Twaa you, enhghten’d from above,
Foresaw aad told that God was love.

You were the ehuroh's hest defense.
Ye martyre now enthron’d on high,
Bravely secure in innocence‚
And holdly resolute to die;
Daring (so firmly ye withstood)
In spite os malice to he good.
