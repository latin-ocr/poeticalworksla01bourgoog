'lhe chain l'll in return untie;

And freely thou again shnlt lly.'’
Thus she the oeptive did deliver;
The eaptive thus gave up his quiver.

The god disarmh, e’er since thot day,
Posses his lile in harmless plny;
Flies round, or sits upon her hreast.
A little, flutt'ring, idle guest.

E’er since thet day, the beauteous maid
Governs the world in Cupid’s steed,
Directs his arrows es she wills;

Gives grief or pleaoure, speres or kills.

CHLOE HUNTING.

ΒΥ emon.

Bemno her neck her oomely tresses tied,

Her iv'ry quiver gracesul hy her side,

A hunting Chloe vente she lost her way,

And through the woods uncertain chme'd to strny.
Apollo passing by beheld the maid ;

And, Sister dear, hright Cynthia, turn, he snid;
The hunted hind lies close in yonder brake.

Loud Cupid laugh’d‚ to see the god’s mistnke:
And laughing eried, Learn better, great divine,
To know thy kindred, and to honour mine.
