These traces sor ever will lnet;
No eiokness or time oon remove,
For when youth and benuty ore pest,
And age brings the winter os love,
A friendship insensihly grows,
By reviews of such rapturos es these;
The current os fondness still flows,
Which decrepit old nge cannot freeze.

THE FLY.

Bosn, curione, thirsty fly,
Drinh with me, and drinh as 1;

Freely weloome to my oup,
Couldst thou sip, and sip it up;
Mahe the most of lite you moy,
Life is short, end weare away.

Both elihe, both thine and mine, ξ
Hasten quiok to their deeline3

Thine's a summer, mine'e no more,
Though repeated to threeseore:
Threesoore summoto, when they'ro gone,
will appear as short os one.
