THE PARROT.

susumus> ΒΥ W· ΟΟἪΡΕΚ, Εδθ.

“Iu painted plumes superhly dress’d,
A native oi the gorgeous east,
By many a hillow toss'd,
Poll gains st length the British shore,
Part os the captain’s precious shore,
A present to his toust.

Belinds’s maids are soon preierr’d.

To taech him now and then a word,
As Poll can master it;

But ’tis her own importum charge, s

To qualiiy him more at large,
And make him quite a wit.

Sweet Polli his doting mistress eries. ·

Sweet Polli the mimic bird replies‚
And calls aloud ior sach.

She next instructs him in the hiss;

”ris now a little one, like Miss‚
And now a hearty smack.
