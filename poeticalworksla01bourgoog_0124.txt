Ye violem, too,
111 fields that gron,

And drink the vemal devm
That dash the woods,
The meede, the floods.

with drops os purple hue.

And all ye flowerS.

Whose wilder stores
O'er nature's sace are seen ;

Whose various dyes

Promiscuous rise,
And paint th· enamell'd green.

Come, herbs‚ all ye

That tempt the bee

r From leaf to leaf to roam;
Whose balmy veins
Reward her pains,

And send her loaded home.

All, all be join'd,
Of ev’ry kind,

Flowers, herbs; the sweet, the gay;
Twist arm in arm,

Weave charm with charm,
To Phyllis haste away.
