The boetswain gave the dreadful word,
The sails their swelling bosom spreed;

No longer must she stay ehoard:

They hiss'd; she sigh'd; he hung his heed:
Her less’ning boat unwilling rows roland ι
Ad'ieur she cries; and waved her lily hand.

Wner heauties does Flora disclosel

How sweet are her smiles upon Tweedh
Yet Mery's, still sweeter then those,

Both nature and fancy exceed.
Nor daiey, nor sweet-blushing rose,

Nor all the gay flow’rs of the field,
Nor Tweed‚ gliding gently through those,
. · Such beeuty and pleesure does yield.

The warblers are heard in the grove,
The linnet, the leth, and the thrush ;
The hlaelrbird, end sweet-cooing dove,
With music enehant ev’ry bush.
Come, let us go forth to the meari,
Let us see how the primroses spring ;
We'll lodge in some village on Tweed‚
And love. where the feethered folks sing.
