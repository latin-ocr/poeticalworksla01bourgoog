‘¹ 0 Sum, Susan, lorely deur!
My rous shall ever true remim
Let me kim off that falling tetra
We only part to meet again.
Change as ye list, ye winds3 my henrt shall be
The faithful comum, that still points to thee.

“Bellene not what the laudmen say,

Whu tempt with doubts thy constant mind ς
They'll tell thee, sallors, when away,

ln every port a mistress find:
Yes‚ yes, believe them when they tell thee so,
For thou ert present, wheresoe'er 1 go.

“ Il to sair India's coast we seil,
Thy eyes are seen in diamonds bright:
Thy breath is Afrio’s spiey gale;
Thy skin is ivory so white:
Thus every beauteous object thet I view,
Wukes ln my soul some cherms of lovely Sue.

‘⁸ Though battle call me from thy arms,
Let not my pretty Susan mourn;

Though cennons soar, yet sale from harms
Willlem shall to his dear return;

Love turns eside the balls that round me fly,
hest precluus teurs should drop from Susan's eye,'’
