Tho' shortsr lines her fix'd domininus bind.

Her flosring empire stretches uneonflned.

From Thetis* stores, and not her neighbours' spoils,

She draws her versure, fruit of honest toils.

Rome seck'd, end plunder'd; Britain clothes and

Aequires their debes, but supplies their needs.

Sweet sest os freedoml be thy happier doom,
To ’serpe the fate, ss well es guilt of Rome:
Where rior, offspring of unwieldy stote,
Enerv'd those arms, that snetch'd the spoil before;
With costly estes she stain’d her frugal heard, ¹
Then with ill-gotten gold she bought a lord.
Οοπιιρῑὶοη, discord, luxury combined.
Down sunlr the sar-samer mistress of mankind.

Hesr, righteous prinee! Ohesr us loud invoke
Thy worth unblemish'd, to evert this stroke:
Yourself so free from ev’ry lawless view,

You scaree admit the homage that is due.

Let other monarche, with invasive bande.

Lessen their people, and extend their lands;

By gesping natione hated end obey'd.

Lords of the deserte, that their swerd has mades
For thee kind hesv’n e nobler task design·d.

ro flx thy empire on thy people’s mind ;
