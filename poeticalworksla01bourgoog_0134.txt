With her bright innoeenes shall go,
Purer than the falling snow:

Quies, that far lrom quarrels flies;
Mirth and pleasnre, love and joys:

Firrn laith, that plighted promise keeps,
silence watohing o’er her lipsa

Prudence‚ that pondere all events,
Wealth-increasing diligenoe:

Religion, mindlul what is owed
To herself and to her God.

Patient to bear. to pardon free,
Loveliest grace, humanityl

Il erring nature chance to fai,
Feeble‚ inadvertent, frail:

Who hates low-whisper'd spite eonceai'd,
Scandal yet to few reveal'd;

Since envy makes, with rumour’d lies
Friends and brethren enemies.

Goon-breeding shall her handmaid be,
Join'd with chaste-look'd modesty;

While open heart, and hand, andiaco,
Hospitality displays.

Il e'er Melissa grace your home,
These attendants with her come.

Whate’er ean good or ill besall,
Faithlnl partner she ol all.

Whose wisdom, teaehing well to bear,
Soothes the bitterness ol eorm

whose joy, ilprosp¹rous fate you meet,
Addo new sweetness to the sweet.
