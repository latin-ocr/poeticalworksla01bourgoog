SWEE'l' WILLIAM'S FAREWELL TO l

BLACK-EYED SUSAN.

a? un.

Αιι in the Downs the fleet was moor'd‚
The streamers waving ln the wind,
When bhck-eyed Susan came on boeth,-
“ Ohl where shall Ι my true love find?
Tell me, ye jovial sallom, tell me true, .
Does my sweet William sail among the crew ?”

william, who high upon the γετὰ,
Rock'd with the billows to and fro,
Soon as her well-known voice he heard,
⁴ He sigh'd, end cast his eyes belovv.
The cord slides swiltly through his glowing hands,
And (quick as lightning) on the decl he stands,

So the sweet lark, high pois’d in air.
Shuts close his pinions to his breaet,
Is chance his mate's shrill note he hear,
And drops at once into her nest.
'l'he noblest captain in the British fleet,
Might envy William‘s lips those hisses sweet.
