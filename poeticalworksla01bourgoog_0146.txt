THE curetur.

Thus thy praise shall be express¹d,
Inoffensive, weloome guest!

While the rut is oh the scoot,

And the mouse with ourious snout‚
With what vermin else infest
Ev’ry dish, and spoil the best;
Frishing thus before 11111111,

Thou 11111111 thino heort's desire.

Though in voice and shape they be
Form’d as 11 ahin 1ο thee,

Thou surpassest‚ happier 111,
Happiest grasshoppers 11111 1111

Theirs is 111111 summer’s song,
Thine endures the winter long,
Unimpair'd und 1111111, and clear,
Melody throughout the year.

Neither night nor down of day,

Puts 1 period to thy play:

Sing, then-and expend thy span

Fur beyond the (111111 man.
Wretched 111111, whose years are spent
In repining discontent,

Lives not, aged though he be,

Halfu spon, compared with thee.
