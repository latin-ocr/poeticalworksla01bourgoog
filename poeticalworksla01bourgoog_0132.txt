112 mass.

She likes not wit in lewdness shown,
J esls ill-manner'd for a clowm

But hensa, wilh ignorance or ruge,
Double meanings of the stage.

ller spolless mind, the lustlul tale
Nauseales in lhe nicest vell.

She ne’er is found in crowds unclean,
Eutred mysteries obscene;

Nor seeks in mask undantis dress,

’ Unconfined lasciviousness:

Nor pale, and sngry, gaming high,
Rattles the unlucky die.

Till sunrise reslless viglls keeps,
Light ¹consuming in her sleeps;

Inverting nature, turns with play
Day lo night, and night to day.

This round ol follies let her choose,
Flitting life who likes lo lose,

And lets her quickly-ending days
Pass, and perlsh ss lhsy pass.

The time that vulgar maids despise,
Careless, though-tless, how it flies,

Melissa wlse, esleems, and knows
Well to use it, ere it goes.

ll e'er Melissa wed my friend,
With her ent’ring shall attend

Virlues and graces by her side,
Bridemaids fil for such a bride:

Neat beauty without art display'd,
Rosy health with native red ;
