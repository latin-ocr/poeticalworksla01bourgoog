Lucr ANB couri«

Oh, here you seen a lily pule,
When hearing ruins descend?

So droop¹d the sion-consuming muido
Her lise now nersr its end.

By Lucy warn'd‚ oi haitering swains
Tske heed, ye ensy fuir:

0f vengeance ducto broken vous,
Ye perjur’d swains, bewsre.

Three times, nil in the desd os night,v
A bell was heard to ring 3

And shrieking ut her window chriso,
The raven flapp‘d his wing.

Τοο well the lore-lorn maiden knew
The solemn hoding sound‚

'And thur, in dying words, bespoke

The virgins weeping round:

“1 hears voice you cannot hest,
Which says, 1 must not stry;

I see n hand you cannot see.
Which beckons me away.

By a false hesrt, snd broken rous,
In early youth Ι die:

Am 1 tc blame. because his bride
Is thrice osrich ss 1?
