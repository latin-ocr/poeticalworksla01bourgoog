THE TEARS OF A PAIN'I'ER.

hassonum> ΒΥ mosem, 880·

Arentes, hearing thot his hoy

Had just expireh-his only joy!
Although the sight with snguish tore him,
Bade ploce his deor remains before him.

He seized his brush,-his colours spread ι
And-‘⁶ Oh Ι my child, accept.f'-he said,

‘⁶ (’Tis all that 1 can now hesrom)
“This tribute os a father's woe1”
Thon, faithful to the twofold port,
Both of his seelings end his art.

He closed his eyes with tendet care,
And sorm'd at once s follow-pair.
His brow with umber looks beset,
And lips, he drew,-not livid yet;
And shsded thot which he hed done
To s just image os his son.

Thus faris well. But view again
The osuse os thy peternsl pain !
Thy mehnoholy tssh sulfil Ι
lt needs the last, lsst touches still.
Agsin h'rs peuoil's powers he tries,
For on his lips s smile he spies;
And still h'rs oheek unseded shows
