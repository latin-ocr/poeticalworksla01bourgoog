SONG OF THE THREE GHILDREN.

Wum'nn God’s flat did from nothing mise,

stupendous productos the first six days,

Ο blesa your Maka, your Creator praise.
In this let jarring elementa agree,

Or make from discord περιθεῖ harmony.

Ye sons os light made by his power divine ;

By hiz reflected beams it is you shine;

Your hallelujnhs ln the chorus join,
Thac, far u creaturos can, your praise may prove
Grent u hl· power, and endless as his love.
