To outlive my sensesd may it not be my iate.

To be blind, to be deas. to know nothing at all;

But rather let death come before 'tis so late,

And while there's some sap‘ in it, may my trees sall.
May Igovern, bc.

I hope 1 shall bnve no occmion to send

For priests or physiciens‚ till I’m so neor my end,

That Ihnve eat nll my breed, and drnnk my leet glossa

Let them come then, and eet their seats ιο my poss}¹
May 1 gottern, 810. ἵ

With a oouroge undaunted, may 1 tace my last day,
And when lam dead may· the better sort say,
In the morning when sober, in the evening when
mellow,
He's gone, and not lest behind him his fellow.
May Igovern, &o

Without any noise,t when I've pess'd o'er the stage,
And decently noted what part fortune* gave, „

⁴¹ May Inot lose my sight, my hearing, and my me·
mory, and be a burden to my friends and mysels: '⁶ Tellu-
risinutile pondus,” a dead ununeful burden to the ground.
⁶ Some cor oreal and intellectual vigour.

Expectando dies homini ert, dicique beatus
Ante obitum nemo supremaque sunere debet. Ονιυ.
lt you tell an Italian, such an one is a rich or happy
man, he'll reply‚ “ Dammi lo morto,” as much as to say,
Let me see bim dead, and then it will be evident whether
he ie or not; before that, no true judgment is to be made.
