Though simple in its dress and plain,
lt ushers in s beauteous train3

And elsims, how guudy e'er they be,
The merit os precedency.

All that the gay or sweet compose,
The pink, the violet, and the rose,
In fair succession ss they blow,

Their glories to the snowdrop owe.

Bmsshhh a myrtle's verdant shads,
As Chloe hals asleep was laid,
Cupid perch'd lightly on her breast,
And in that heaven desired to rest:
Over her paps his wlngs he spread,
Between he found a downy bed,
And nestled in his little head.

scih lay the god: the nymph surp'ris‘ed
Yet mistress of herself, devised
How she the vagrant might enthrsl,
And captive him, who captives ull.
Her boddice half-way she unlaced:

¹About his arms she slily cast
The silken hond, and held him fast. .
