ΤΗΙ ΙΒΙΔΤΗ.

A year consumes,
Another comes,

And then n new tales place:
Another new

Shell then eosne,
Another neon-to pose.

Bur, ull the while,
Her beauties smile,
And lempt the lover’s care:

A year consumes,
Another oomes;

And Phyllis still is sair.

To all one date
Assigns nullate,
As plain, too plain, appeam
Your glories live,
Days four or five,
But hers as many years.

Yet, gentlest tace,
Your fieeting grace
To blooming Phyllis lond ι

And, as you fode,
Remind the maid,

'ron years, lilre days, must end.
