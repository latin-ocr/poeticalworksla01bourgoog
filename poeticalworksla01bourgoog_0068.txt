How oould you promise loreto me,
And not thot promise ireep?

Why did yon swenr mine eyes were bright. ¹
Yet leave those 'eyes to weep?

How could yon say, my lip was errem,
And made the scariot pale?

And why d'ni 1, young vitlem maid.
Believe the flett’ring tole?

Thai iace, eles! no more is inim
Thai lip no longer red ;

Dork ere mine eyes, now closed in death,
And ev'ry oherrn isfled.

The hungry worm rny sister is;
This winding-sheet 1 neon

And cold and weery lasis our night,
Till that lost morn appear.

Bur heri! the ooek hes worn'd me henoe;
A long and last adieui

Come see, saise mani how low she lieS,
Ther died sor love oi you.

Now birds did sing, end morning ennio,
And show her glittering head:

Pale Willinm shook in every linrb,
Then roving lest his bed.
